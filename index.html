subtitle: Who am I?
---


<p>I am Hossain Muhammad Muctadir, a researcher specializing in software engineering, with a particular focus on digital
    twin technologies. Currently, I am pursuing a PhD at Eindhoven University of Technology, where my research explores
    advanced methods for consistency management in digital twin models. My recent studies also examine trends and
    challenges in digital twin development, maintenance, and operations, contributing valuable insights to this evolving
    field.</p>

<p>My academic background includes an Engineering Doctorate (EngD) from Eindhoven University, where I developed a <a
        href="https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/model-as-a-service-towards-a-discovery-platform-for-internet-of-f">model-sharing
        platform for the Internet of Food</a>, and a Masterâ€™s degree in Software Systems Engineering from RWTH Aachen
    University, where my research focused on <a href="/files/my_thesis/Masterarbeit.pdf">software product line
        extraction and similarity analysis</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to my studies, I have significant industry experience, collaborating with organizations such as Philips
    Research, ASML, and Unilever on AI-driven healthcare applications, software dependency management tools, and
    agricultural drone systems. Prior to my work in the Netherlands, I gained industry experience in Germany, where I
    contributed to software development and mixed reality projects using tools like .NET MVC, WebApi2, and Unity3D.
    Earlier in my career, I worked in Bangladesh, focusing on software project management applications and digital graph
    data generation.</p>

---

<p>I am a PhD candidate at the Software Engineering and Technology cluster at the <a href="https://www.tue.nl">Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)</a>. My primary research is focused on developing necessary methodology and tooling for managing consistency among cross-domain models in the context of a digital twin. This project is part of the Digital Twin project funded by NWO (<a href="https://www.nwo.nl/en">Dutch Research Council</a>).</p>
<p>My research interests and published works are available <a href="/pages/research">here</a>.</p>

<p style="color: brown; font-style: italic;">As I am in the finishing phase of my PhD, I am currently looking for research positions to join after completing PhD. My interests include model-driven engineering, digital twins, and related topics. Please, consult my <a href="/files/Resume_Muctadir.pdf">resume</a> and <a href="/pages/research">research page</a> to know more about me and my research.</p>

<h2 id="academic-background">Academic background</h2>

<p>I received my bachelor’s degree in Information Technology with a Software Engineering major from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh (2013) and master’s degree in Software Systems Engineering from RWTH Aachen University, Germany (2017). I worked with FEV GmbH (Alsdorf, Germany) for my master’s thesis where I studied Software Product Line (SPL) in the context of the automotive industry and implemented a similarity analysis framework that helps to identify SPLs from existing software components.</p>

<p>I obtained Engineering Doctorate (EngD) degree in Software Technology from Eindhoven University of Technology in 2020. During my <a href="https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/model-as-a-service-towards-a-discovery-platform-for-internet-of-f">graduation project</a>, I designed and developed a platform named MaaS (Model as a Service). With this platform organizations can share heterogeneous computational models as service among themselves without sharing the model themselves. This work was executed in the context of <a href="https://www.sfifood.nl">Sustainable Food Initiative</a> and <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/news-and-events/news-overview/14-02-2022-internet-of-food/">Internet of Food</a> project.</p>

<h2 id="experiences">Experiences</h2>

<p>Since 2011, I have worked as a professional software developer in different organizations in Bangladesh, Germany, and the Netherlands. During this period, I developed desktop and web applications as well as augmented reality applications for HoloLens.

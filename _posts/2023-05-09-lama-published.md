Last year I was part of a bachelors group project at TU Eindhoven where the students developed a web application for labeling and thematically analyzing texts. The tool is now published at [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/). The tool is called LaMa, short for Labelling Machine, is based on an existing tool called [labeling machine](https://github.com/muctadir/labeling-machine) which is a fork of a [prior version](https://github.com/emadpres/labeling-machine). The paper can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.05135) and the code in [Github](https://github.com/muctadir/lama).

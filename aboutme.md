I am a PhD candidate at the Software Engineering and Technology cluster at the [Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)](https://www.tue.nl). My primary research is focused on developing necessary methodology and tooling for managing consistency among cross-domain models in the context of a digital twin. This project is part of the Digital Twin project funded by NWO ([Dutch Research Council](https://www.nwo.nl/en)).

My research interests and published works are available [here](/pages/research).

## Academic background

I received my bachelor’s degree in Information Technology with a Software Engineering major from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh (2013) and master’s degree in Software Systems Engineering from RWTH Aachen University, Germany (2017). I worked with FEV GmbH (Alsdorf, Germany) for my master’s thesis where I studied Software Product Line (SPL) in the context of the automotive industry and implemented a similarity analysis framework that helps to identify SPLs from existing software components.

I obtained Engineering Doctorate (EngD) degree in Software Technology from Eindhoven University of Technology in 2020. During my [graduation project](https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/model-as-a-service-towards-a-discovery-platform-for-internet-of-f), I designed and developed a platform named MaaS (Model as a Service). With this platform organizations can share heterogeneous computational models as service among themselves without sharing the model themselves. This work was executed in the context of [Sustainable Food Initiative](https://www.sfifood.nl) and [Internet of Food](https://www.tue.nl/en/news-and-events/news-overview/14-02-2022-internet-of-food/) project.

## Experiences

Since 2011, I have worked as a professional software developer in different organizations in Bangladesh, Germany, and the Netherlands. During this period, I developed desktop and web applications as well as augmented reality applications for HoloLens.
